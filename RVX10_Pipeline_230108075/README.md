# RVX10-P: Five-Stage Pipelined RISC-V Processor

## Overview

**RVX10-P** is a five-stage pipelined processor implementing the **RISC-V RV32I** instruction set, extended with ten additional arithmetic and logic operations under the **RVX10** custom extension.  
This processor was developed as part of the **Digital Logic and Computer Architecture** course under **Dr. Satyajit Das, IIT Guwahati**.

The design correctly executes all base RV32I and RVX10 instructions, manages both data and control hazards using **forwarding**, **stalls**, and **flush mechanisms**, and integrates **performance counters** to measure the average **Cycles Per Instruction (CPI)**.

---

## Pipeline Architecture

The processor adopts the classic **five-stage pipeline** organization:

| Stage | Name | Function |
| :----: | :---- | :-------- |
| **IF** | Instruction Fetch | Retrieves instructions from instruction memory (IMEM) |
| **ID** | Instruction Decode / Register Read | Decodes opcodes and accesses source registers |
| **EX** | Execute | Performs ALU computations and evaluates branch conditions |
| **MEM** | Memory Access | Reads from or writes to data memory (DMEM) |
| **WB** | Write Back | Writes computed results back to the register file |

## Core Components

### ðŸ”¹ Datapath
Implements the complete five-stage pipeline with **valid-bit tracking**.  
Incorporates **forwarding logic**, **stall and flush control**, and supports both **RV32I** and **RVX10** ALU operations.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Control Unit
Responsible for generating all control signals for the ALU, memory access, and register file.  
It consists of:
- **maindec** â€“ decodes instruction opcodes  
- **aludec** â€“ interprets function fields for ALU operation selection  

---

### ðŸ”¹ Forwarding Unit
Detects data dependencies between the **EX**, **MEM**, and **WB** stages and forwards the required operands to the ALU, minimizing stalls.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Hazard Detection Unit
Identifies **load-use** and **branch hazards**, inserting stalls or flushes when necessary to maintain correct execution order.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Performance Counters
Tracks both the **total cycle count** and **number of executed instructions**, allowing computation of the processorâ€™s **CPI** (Cycles Per Instruction).
